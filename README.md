# Flight-Price-Prediction

* The objective of this project is to implement a regressor to predict the fares of flights on the basis of different features like source, destination , date etc.

* The model is exported and an instance of the same is implemented using Flask.

* The algorithm used for this project was Random Forest, which performed well after adequate feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

* The model attained adjusted R^2 score of 90.30%.
